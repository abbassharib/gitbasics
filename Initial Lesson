What is GIT?
Git is standard version control system. Version control is a tool that helps to manage changes made to source code and documents 
time by time. It keeps records of every modification made to the code, project or doc. It is a kind of database that stores changes made to 
source code/doc/project in chronological manner and then allowing you to reference them as needed.


 This is basic GIT workflow and commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
 

-git init creates a new Git repository. 
 Example: git init
    Repository is a central location in which data is stored and managed.

-git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area. 
 Example: git status filename.extention .
    A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files.
    A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory.
    
-git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area. 
 Exampple: git add filename.extension . 

-git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area. Example: git diff filename.extention

-git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository. 
 Example: git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
    Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:
      Must be in quotation marks.
      Written in the present tense.
      Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m.
      
-git log shows a list of all previous commits. Example: git log
